Definition of Converge

For any positive e, |a_n - a| < e when n is sufficiently large <=> a_n converges to a.

For any positive e, there exists N, for any n > N, |a_n - a| < e <=> a_n converges to a.

Definition of Diverse

There exists positive e, |a_n - a| >= e even if n is sufficiently large  <=> a_n does not converge to a.

There exists positive e, for any N, there exists n > N, |a_n - a| >= e <=> a_n does not converge to a.
