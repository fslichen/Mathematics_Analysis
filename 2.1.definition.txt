Definition of Converge I
For any positive e, |a_n - a| < e when n is sufficiently large <=> a_n converges to a.

Definition of Converge II
For any positive e, there exists N, for any n > N, |a_n - a| < e <=> a_n converges to a.

Comment about Converge II
N is a function of e.

Definition of Diverse I
There exists positive e, |a_n - a| >= e even if n is large  <=> a_n does not converge to a.

Definition of Diverse II
There exists positive e, there does not exist N, for any n > N, |a_n - a| < e <=> a_n does not converge to a.

Definition of Diverse III
There exists positive e, there exists N, for any n > N, |a_n - a| >= e <=> a_n does not converge to a.

Definition of Converge III
From Definition of Diverse III, if a_n does not converge to a, infinite a_n fall outside of U(a, e) => if finite a_n fall outside of U(a, e), a_n converges to a.
